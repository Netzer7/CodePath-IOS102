### Notes
Had some difficulties getting the views to display correctly but the actual programming side was straight forward. I went ahead and had the collection view redirect to the same detail view screen that the table view used.

### Notes
I tried to use constraints to make the title and synopsis text scale down/ fit in the screen but couldn't seem to find the proper way. Instead it will simply trail off, hoping to resolve this at some point.
